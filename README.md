I'm a Frontend Engineer at [Sojilearn](https://sojilearn.com). I'm curiously drawn to sharing knowledge, documentation, web engineering, animations, AI and others. I am looking forward to new opportunity for growth working with cross functional teams in a remote setting, speaking at meetups/conferences, and building technical communities.

**Here's a quick summary about me**:

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning and AI.
- 😊 Are you looking for help with projects, do you have information on Junior-level and Intermediate-level opportunities? Please reach out.
- 💼 Job interests: Software Engineer, Front Engineer, or UI Engineer (Junior or Mid-level).
